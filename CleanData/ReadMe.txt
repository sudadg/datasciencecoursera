This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.


Step 1 : Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "data".
Make sure the folder "data" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory.
Step 2 : use "run_analysis.R" command in RStudio and see CodeBook.md for detail technical specification.
Step 3: Once "run_analysis.R"" is ran we get output of averages_data.txt which is final output with clean data.
